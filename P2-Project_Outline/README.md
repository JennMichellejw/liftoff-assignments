## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A web app which will allow users to store and track inventory items to be loaned out. A loan will store a borrow, item, return date, and any repayment agreements between the loaner and borrower. Borrow statistics will be tracked upon the return of a loan, based on the items condition and the return date.

This idea came to me after seeing friends use notepads to keep track of personal loans among friends or band mates. It can be useful to anyone who regularly loans out items such as tools, musical equipment, or media to friends or acquaintances.  



### Features

User login: Users will be able to log-in in order to store inventory items and loans
Search: Users will be able to search for items, borrowers, active, and inactive loans
Create Loans: Users will be able to create and return loans with an item and borrower attached
Update Borrow Status: Users will be able to update the status of a borrower based on loan return condition and return date
